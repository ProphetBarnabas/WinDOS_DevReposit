CLIShell version: v1.0
New project name is WinDOS instead of MS-DOS!
Full code rewrite!


---------------------------------------

============================================================================================================================================

WinDOS v3.1
CLIShell version: v1.0
Added registry editor, minor changes/fixes.


---------------------------------------

	- New command: REGEDIT; while in "regedit" mode, type help for regedit commands
	
	- Regedit commands:
		
		- CSK               Changes the current subkey
		
		- SK-GET            Returns a subkey name list of a specified subkey

		- SK-MAKE			Creates a new subkey inside a specified subkey
		
		- SK-DELETE			Deletes the specified subkey and its subkey tree
		
		- VAL-GET			Returns all registry values of a specfied subkey

		- VAL-SET 			Modifies an existing value in the current subkey

		- VAL-MAKE			Creates a new value in the current subkey

		- VAL-DELETE		Deletes the specified value

		- VAL-RENAME		Renames the specified value

		- CLS				Clears the screen
		
		- EXIT				Returns to "default" mode

	
	- Created auto complete search pools: sk-; val-

	
	- SHMOTD command renamed to STARTUP-SHMOTD
		
	- MOTD command renamed to STARTUP-MOTD
	
	
	- Fixed: Unable to scroll input field
	
	- Fixed: Default icon appears on taskbar
	
	- Fixed: Input field is inaccessible after startup
	
	- Fixed: Highly inaccurate help text in "regedit" mode
	
============================================================================================================================================

WinDOS v3.2
CLIShell version: v1.0
Fixed issues, new commands, minor modifications


---------------------------------------

	- New command: PING; Attempts to ping the specified hostname or ip address; it accepts -t(endless ping) as an optional argument

	- New command: STARTUP-VERBOSE; Shows or skips the loading screen at startup; its arguments are either 0(off) or 1(on)
	
	- Bootloader rework:
		
		- Booting from BOOT.ini is now more stable and reliable
		
		- Boot source hierachy is more consistent, Basic boot source's only purpose is to create Registry/INI boot sources
		
		- BOOT.ini stores startup config in a different form

	- Fixes:
	
		- Unhandled exception when auto complete is triggered but user input is not present
		
		- If emulation is turned on when closing the application, explorer.exe does not restart
		
		- Auto complete does not apply for HELP and EXIT commands in "regedit" mode

		- DIR command accepts only full directory path
		
		- Help text inaccuracies
	
	- Misc:
	
		- Text length limit is set to 800.000 characters when using FC and OPEN commands 
		  (temporary solution to permanent unresponsiveness when displaying too much text)
		 
		- MD and MF commands now accepts full path as well as directory/file names
		
		- Modified nmap output format
		
============================================================================================================================================

WinDOS v3.2
CLIShell version: v1.1
New commands, basic interpreter, optimization, visual upgrade, command system rework, text engine, fixes.

---------------------------------------

	NEW SYSTEM COMPONENTS
	
		- Basic interpreter by CLIShell v1.1: 
		
			- Replaces obsolete Disc Engine
			
			- Allows filter argument by glob patterns:

				- Glob characters: 
				
					""(double quote):    no matter what is between double quotes, it is interpreted as one argument, also all glob patterns are ineffective
					
					*(asterisk):         *filter means anything that ends with 'filter'; filter* means anything that starts with 'filter' (cannot be both)
					
					!(exclamation mark): !filter means anythig that does not equal to 'filter'
					
					All possible glob patterns('filter' is an example text): "filter", !"filter", !*"filter", !"filter"*, *"filter", "filter"*, 
																			 !filter, !*filter, !filter*, *filter, filter*
		
		- Text engine (animates text as its being drawn)
